        <h2>Languages</h2>

        <p>
          My Grandfather, Joseph Andréo, grew up in a town just across the French side of the border with Spain. He lived with my Grandmother on his father’s ranch in Morocco, until my Mother’s sister was born, and they moved to England.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joseph therefore was able to speak French, Spanish, Arabic, and English. It has long been a goal of mine to honor him by gaining proficiency in these languages.
        </p><p>
          My French is officially <span class="info "title="CEFR level B2, approximately ILR level 2+)">Conversational</span> and I know enough Spanish to get myself into trouble, but not out of it. Arabic… well I can identify a few letters, and say ‘Thank you’…
        </p>
Joseph never needed<ul class="skills"><li>HTML</li> <li>CSS</li> or <li>Javascript</li></ul>it was a different time after all - but I like to think he’d be pleased with how well I’ve learnt those languages too...
