          My experiences with Lighting design, set design, and video editing have left me well versed both in using technology to make art, and also in creative problem solving.

Almost two decades working as a freelance Actor, Director, and Writer have given me a a wealth of experience in choosing the parts of a story to highlight, how to see something from an audience’ perspective, to find the most compelling way to communicate a message.

In many previous roles I’ve served as the first point of contact for a company, or the face or voice of the organization. Not only as that given me great experience in dealing with a diverse array of people, and in succinctly and consistently delivering an approved message, but also given me experience navigating a variety of different CRMs/ databases.

        <h2>Languages</h2>

        <p>
          My Grandfather, Joseph Andréo, grew up in a town just across the French side of the border with Spain. He lived with my Grandmother on his father’s ranch in Morocco, until my Mother’s sister was born, and they moved to England. Joseph therefore was able to speak French, Spanish, Arabic, and English. It has long been a goal of mine to honor him by gaining proficiency in these languages. My French is officially ‘Conversational’ (CEFR level B2, approximately ILR level 2+) and I know enough Spanish to get myself into trouble, but not out of it. Arabic… well I can identify a few letters, and say ‘Thank you’…

Joseph never needed HTML, CSS, or Javascript - it was a different time after all - but I like to think he’d be pleased with how well I’ve learnt those languages too.
